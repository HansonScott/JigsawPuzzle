# JigsawPuzzle
After hearing that jigsaw puzzle apps are a rising thing, and the concept of digitizing it is interesting to me.  Starting a project to research and prototype the technology of image manipulation, object organization, random piece generation, etc.

Features:
- puzzle variables:
  - upload and image to use as the puzzle content.
  - user-set grid size (number of pieces)
  - complex edge variables for the piece generation
  - options and variables to set the parameters of piece generation
- playing field variables:
  - piece pile
  - final puzzle area
  - subjective groups
  - zooming from the overall 'table' area, across piles, pieces, and down into a piece, and even to an edge
